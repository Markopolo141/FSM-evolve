\abstract{A evolutionary game is introduced which considers game-theoretic strategies in non-linear population matrix models.
This game considers the states and actions of the organisms of the evolving population, and a notion of dynamic equilibrium between strategies is described.
The game's formalism is expounded and a proof about equilibrium is given; specifically that any stable equilibrium can be described by proportions of pure strategies - particularly when population matricies are not defective. }
