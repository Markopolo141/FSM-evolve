\begin{abstract}
We consider game-theoretic strategies in the context of non-linear population matrix models. 
Particularly we consider the states and actions of the organisms of the evolving population, and a notion of dynamic equilibrium between strategies is described. 
The game's formalism is expounded and a proof about equilibrium is given; specifically that any stable equilibrium can be described by proportions of pure strategies; 
particularly when population matrices are not defective.
