\section{A Quick Example}\label{sec:example}

One of the most famous evolutionary games is that of Hawk-Dove\cite{maynard} which has been extended to multiple states by Eitan Altman et al\cite{markov5, markov3}. A simplified version of Altman's game (as presented in \cite{markov5}) is as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item   $K = \{b\}$ A singular species of $b$ird
\item	$S=S_b = \{\mathbf{y},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{p}\}$ are the states of: $\mathbf{y}$oung, $\mathbf{a}$gressive adult, $\mathbf{p}$assive adult
\item	$A=A_b = \{R_\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{p},G_\mathbf{a},G_\mathbf{p}\}$, $A_{b,\mathbf{y}}=\{G_\mathbf{a},G_\mathbf{p}\}$, $A_{b,\mathbf{p}}=\{R_\mathbf{p}\}$, $A_{b,\mathbf{a}}=\{R_\mathbf{a}\}$ are actions available to various states: $G_\mathbf{a}$/$G_\mathbf{p}$ is grow into aggressive/passive adult, $R_\mathbf{a}$/$R_\mathbf{p}$ is reproduce aggressively/passively.
\item   All the transmission rates are:\\
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
$T_{b,\mathbf{y},G_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=0$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{y},G_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=0$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{y},R_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=2(1-p)$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{y},R_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=1-p+A$ \\
$T_{b,\mathbf{a},G_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=1-pC$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{a},G_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=0$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=0$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=0$ \\
$T_{b,\mathbf{p},G_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=DpC$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{p},G_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=DpC+1-pC$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{p},R_\mathbf{a}}(P^*_t)=0$ &
$T_{b,\mathbf{p},R_\mathbf{p}}(P^*_t)=0$ \\
\end{tabular}
where $A,D,C$ are parameters of the game all between $0$ and $1$, and $p=\frac{P^*_{t,b,\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{a}}}{P^*_{t,b,\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{a}}+P^*_{t,b,\mathbf{p},R_\mathbf{p}}}$
\end{itemize}
It is noted that the only state which has multiple actions available to it is $\mathbf{y}$ with $G_\mathbf{a}$ and $G_\mathbf{p}$, and therefore the any strategy $w^b$ is totally specified once $\gamma = w^b_{G_\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y}}$ is specified, thus all strategies of the game can be parameterised by a single number $\gamma$, with $0\le\gamma\le 1$.\\
If the states are indexed in order $\mathbf{y},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{p}$ and the actions are indexed in order $R_\mathbf{a},R_\mathbf{p},G_\mathbf{a},G_\mathbf{p}$ then a strategy $w^b$ where $\gamma = w^b_{G_\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y}}$ has transmission matrix $m_{i,j}$ of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hd_transmission} m_{i,j} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 2(1-p) & 1-p+A & \\
    \gamma(1-pC) & 0 & 0  & \\
     DpC+(1-\gamma)(1-pC)  & 0 & 0  & \\
\end{bmatrix} \end{equation}
The demographic flow of organisms of strategy $w^b$ between states can be visualised as per Figure \ref{fig:flow}.

\label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

We compared the results of the python software (of section \ref{sec:implementation}) on the Hawk-Dove game with those obtained by mathematical analysis (as given in Appendix \ref{appendix3}) and also via stochastic simulation.

The Moran process is a very simple stochastic model of the evolution of finite populations, wherein each 'turn' a random individual is chosen for reproduction proportional to its fitness and a corresponding random individual is chosen for death, the Moran process is generally regarded as a cornerstone technique of stochastic evolutionary game dynamics.\cite{stochastic1}

A Moran process for the above game is programmed (with source-code shown in Appendix \ref{appendix4}) and the results of the Moran process against the python implementation and mathematical analysis are shown in figure \ref{fig:bigfigure}.
The figure shows the value $p$ (the proportion of adults that are aggressive) and the proportion of young ($\%Y$) at equilibrium against the parameter $A$ for fixed $C$ and $D$ and shows a strong coincidence in achieving a non-trivial result for all three methodologies.
